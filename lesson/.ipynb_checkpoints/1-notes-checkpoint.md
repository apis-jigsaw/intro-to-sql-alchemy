Migrating a Flask codebase to use SQLAlchemy can be a fairly straightforward process. Here are the general steps to follow:

Install SQLAlchemy: First, you need to install SQLAlchemy. You can do this by running pip install sqlalchemy.

Import SQLAlchemy: Once you have installed SQLAlchemy, you need to import it in your Flask application. You can do this by adding the following code to your app.py file:

python
Copy code
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///example.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
Here, we are creating a db object that we will use to interact with the database.

Define your models: Next, you need to define your database models using SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system. For example, if you have a users table, you can define a User class as follows:
python
Copy code
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<User %r>' % self.username
Here, we are defining a User class that inherits from db.Model (the base class for all models in SQLAlchemy). We are also defining the columns for our users table.

Migrate your database: Once you have defined your models, you need to create your database schema. You can do this by running the following commands:
csharp
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
These commands will initialize a migration repository, generate a migration script, and apply the migration to your database, respectively.

Update your views: Finally, you need to update your Flask views to use SQLAlchemy. For example, if you want to create a new user, you can do it as follows:
python
Copy code
from flask import request

@app.route('/users', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    username = request.json['username']
    email = request.json['email']
    user = User(username=username, email=email)
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()
    return {'id': user.id, 'username': user.username, 'email': user.email}
Here, we are creating a new User object, adding it to the database session, and committing the changes to the database.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to migrate your Flask codebase to use SQLAlchemy.
